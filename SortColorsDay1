Solve the second problem of day 2
Sort Colors:
Sort the colors given as 0,1,2
It can be done in different ways:
Using Dutch National Flag algorithm:
Her both low and mid values are initialized to 0
And high to the last element
We will compare mid with 0,1,2, 
if mid is 0 then swap it with low and increment mid and low as the low elements doesnot need revaluation.
if mid is 1 then leave it and increment 1
if mid is 2 then swap high and mid andd decrement high only because there is no need to decrement the mid as before all are zeroes.
class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
        int low=0,mid=0,high=nums.size()-1;
     while(mid<=high){
         if(nums[mid]==0){
             swap(nums[low],nums[mid]);
             low++;
             mid++;
         }
         else if(nums[mid]==1){
             mid++;
         }
         else{
             swap(nums[mid],nums[high]);
             high--;
         
             
     }
     }
    }
    
};
