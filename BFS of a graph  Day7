BFS of a graph
Here we push the 0 in it and mark it as visited 
then we if the queue is not empty pop the front and add to the answer and for all adjacents of the node if not visited mark it as visited and add it in the queue
class Solution {
  public:
    // Function to return Breadth First Traversal of given graph.
    vector<int> bfsOfGraph(int V, vector<int> adj[]) {
       vector<int>ans;
       queue<int>q;
       int vis[10000]={0};
       vis[0]=1;
       q.push(0);
       while(!q.empty()){
       int a=q.front();
       q.pop();
       ans.push_back(a);
       for(auto x:adj[a]){
           if(!vis[x]){
               vis[x]=1;
               q.push(x);
           }
       }
       }
       return ans;
       
    }
};
