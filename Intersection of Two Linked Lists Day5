To find the intersection in both the linked lists
Here the both are checked until they are equal
if they reach end it leads to nullptr
if they are equal then they found the intersection node
ore else if they both are nullptr then it returns nullptr as there is no intersection among them
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *getIntersectionNode(ListNode *headA, ListNode *headB) {
      ListNode* a=headA;
        ListNode* b=headB;
        while(a!=b){
        a=(a==nullptr)?headB:a->next;
            b=(b==nullptr)?headA:b->next;
            
        }
        return a;
        
    }
};
