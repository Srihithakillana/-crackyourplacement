We can do memoization and remove the steps in the decision tree and come to a final tree where the result of one is equal to the sum of previous two possibilities
class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        if(n<=2){
            return n;
        }
        int a=1;
        int b=2;
    int ans=0;
        for(int i=3;i<=n;i++){
            ans=a+b;
            a=b;
            b=ans;
        }
        return b;
    }
};
