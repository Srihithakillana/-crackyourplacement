1st prob on day 5
To get the decimal number from linked list 
Here multiply every time with 2 and add the value of the node 
Because as we divide with 2 and gets the remainder in the same way to get the reverse just multiply by  and add the node value
class Solution {
public:
    int getDecimalValue(ListNode* head) {
        int num=0;
        while(head!=NULL){
    num=num*2+head->val;
            head=head->next;
        }
        return num;
    }
};
